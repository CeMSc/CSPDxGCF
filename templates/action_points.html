                                            <p style="text-align:justify">Considering the (sometimes complex) interactions between the impacts of climate change and conflict is particularly important in an area vulnerable to climate change and affected by underlying tensions, whether they are rooted in ethnic, economic, linguistic or social differences. The impacts of climate change can worsen these dividing lines, risking the smooth implementation of project activities. In addition, projects can sometimes unintentionally make the situation worse if the project is &lsquo;blind&rsquo; to those conflict drivers. But equally, being aware of the conflict drivers enables the project to have a &lsquo;peace-positive&rsquo; impact.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align:justify">A conflict assessment (or a climate-conflict assessment) is an important first step to understand the underlying drivers of conflict in your project area, to anticipate problems, to ensure your project is not making them worse, and to develop &lsquo;peace-positive&rsquo; solutions. Using a conflict &lsquo;lens&rsquo; is an important way to think through the risks of the project being derailed by, or adding to, conflict. It can be done as a part of the broad socioeconomic risk assessment, or as a separate, additional exercise.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align:justify">The process of developing your conflict assessment can be as important as the product itself. It is an opportunity to engage with your stakeholders to better understand their needs and concerns. It is also a chance to involve as many of the project team as possible to raise their awareness of the political and social dynamics in the project area. The conflict assessment should be a &lsquo;living document&rsquo; &ndash; something that you can come back to and use time and again as the project evolves.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The conflict assessment should contain the following elements, depending on the needs of your specific project. First, you can use the assessment already done under the climate rationale on the current and projected climate impacts to assess the coping and adaptation capacity and how the project may affect conflict dynamics in the project area. Second, you can build on the mapping of the social and environmental dynamics around the natural resources affected by the project (e.g. land, water, energy) to forecast how the project might/ will change access, control and use of those resources. Finally, it will be key to assess the stakeholders who will be affected by the project, how and to what extent.</p>

The impacts of climate change can worsen these dividing lines, and risk the smooth implementation of project activities.

This is particularly important for sometimes marginalised groups that may otherwise be left out of the design or implementation of the project: such as women, youth, older people, minorities, and the disabled.&nbsp; Involving these stakeholders in the production of a conflict assessment (through focus group discussions, consultations, and - where appropriate - in the analysis team itself) &nbsp;is essential to ensuring that the project includes mechanisms to ensure the full participation of these groups in the project and anticipates potential conflict that could derail the project, ensures that the project does no harm by exacerbating underlying causes of tension, and maximises the opportunities to support peace in the project area.</p>

Where appropriate, your funding proposal should identify external conflict as a potential risk and outline a plan for mitigating conflict and promoting peace in the targeted region/area. While developing the Theory of Change of the funding proposal, you can identify the pitfalls and levers to mitigate security impacts and maximise co-benefits to increase the resilience of the most vulnerable people and communities by defining the components that can deepen the rift between communities, or, on the contrary, bring them together.</p>

                                            <p style="text-align:justify">Considering the (sometimes complex) interactions between the impacts of climate change and conflict is particularly important in an area vulnerable to climate change and affected by underlying tensions, whether they are rooted in ethnic, economic, linguistic or social differences.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align:justify">The impacts of climate change can worsen these dividing lines, risking the smooth implementation of project activities. In addition, projects can sometimes unintentionally make the situation worse if the project is &lsquo;blind&rsquo; to those conflict drivers. But equally, being aware of the conflict drivers enables the project to have a &lsquo;peace-positive&rsquo; impact.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The conflict assessment should contain the following elements, depending on the needs of your specific project. First, you can use the assessment already done under the climate rationale on the current and projected climate impacts to assess the coping and adaptation capacity and how the project may affect conflict dynamics in the project area. Second, you can build on the mapping of the social and environmental dynamics around the natural resources affected by the project (e.g. land, water, energy) to forecast how the project might/ will change access, control and use of those resources. Finally, it will be key to assess the stakeholders who will be affected by the project, how and to what extent.</p>

                                            <p style="text-align:justify">Considering how stakeholders can participate in, benefit from, and be empowered by the project is a critical part of designing a successful, impactful project. This is particularly important for sometimes marginalised groups that may otherwise be left out of the design or implementation of projects. Examples of these groups include women, youth, older people, minorities, and the disabled.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align:justify">Involving these stakeholders in the production of a conflict assessment is essential to ensuring that the project includes mechanisms to ensure the full participation of these groups in the project and anticipates potential conflict issues that could derail the project, ensures that the project does no harm by exacerbating underlying causes of tension, and maximises the opportunities to support peace in the project area.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In some funds, like the Green Climate Fund, stakeholder engagement is a key component of the Revised <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/environmental-and-social-policy">Environmental and Social Policy</a> that applies to all activities financed by the GCF, and to both private and public sector accredited entities. Indeed, requiring accredited and direct acccess entities to establish meaningful consultation and engagement processes is a strategic priority embedded in the environmental and social management system for GCF and the environmental and social safeguards, Revised <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/environmental-and-social-policy">Environmental and Social Policy</a>, Updated <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/gender-policy">Gender Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/indigenous-peoples-policy">Indigenous Peoples Policy</a>.</p>                                            <p style="text-align:justify">The production of the assessment itself is an opportunity to engage with your stakeholders to better understand their needs and concerns. It can help to understand how the project can play a role to improve general awareness of people&#39;s rights and responsibilities over the natural resources involved in the project (forests, water, land, etc.). It may also be helpful to assess perceptions of the project and potential negative effects of resource allocation (whether verified or perceived), and the perception of RAFT (Respect, Accountability, Fairness and Transparency) on the part of beneficiaries.</p>

                                            <p style="text-align:justify">There are many such measures including:</p>

If necessary, list potential mechanisms for engagement with armed groups, in the implementation arrangement, stakeholder engagement plan as well as one of the mitigation measures in the Risk Management and mitigation measures section of the funding proposal.</p>

While drafting the conflict assessment, you should conduct a gender and social inclusion analysis in line with the objectives of the IFF or climate fund (see for example the GCF <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/sites/default/files/document/gcf-gender-policy.pdf">Gender Policy)</a> on how the conflict situation is specifically affecting women, girls, men, boys, other genders and gender identities. You should also ensure that the needs of female staff, partners and beneficiaries are fully reflected in staff training in conflict management, contingency plans and monitoring mechanisms.</p>

During and after activities, it is key to monitor both operational risks, as well as the project&rsquo;s impacts on the security context. Monitoring should not hinder action but rather it should serve as a management tool to correct the course of action of the programme as and when needed. Pre-determined measures/ protocols for such monitoring help to ensure that sufficient attention is paid to ongoing &lsquo;horizon scanning&rsquo;. Data on the evolution and emergence of sources of tension and cohesion, changing dynamics that can impact the project, and the good implementation of conflict sensitivity measures is particularly relevant. During activities&rsquo; rollout, operational risks can be mitigated by robust early-warning systems for insecurity, engagement with arms carriers, and contingency funding for security-related delays.</p>

Contingency planning is an important way of ensuring that the project has the means to address sudden changes in the context of the project with as few impacts on results, staff and beneficiaries as possible. It requires assessing the identified risks to the project (such as political instability etc), their likelihood and their impact on project delivery if they came to pass. It then requires you to think through the contingency steps (or mitigating measures) you would take if those risks happened, and ensure that everyone associated is familiar and comfortable with those plans. Contingency steps can take multiple forms depending on the particular context you encounter: flexible delivery timelines, pre-arranged meeting points for staff, a specific budget line for unexpected expenses and so on.</p>

If staff do not already possess these skills, it is important to invest in building, or refreshing them. These range from staff safety (such as <a href="https://www.centreforsafety.org/what-is-heat-training/">Hostile Environment Awareness Training</a>) to conflict analysis, risk assessment, mediation and conflict management.</p>

It may also be useful to identify a crisis response team, or a mix of staff with specific expertise to be able to respond in the event of serious threats to project implementation or staff, partners and/or beneficiaries. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

For example, the Revised <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/environmental-and-social-policy">Environmental and Social Policy</a> of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) applies to all activities financed by the GCF, and to both private and public sector accredited entities. In the case of the GCF, requiring accredited entities (AEs) to establish meaningful consultation and engagement processes is a strategic priority embedded in the environmental and social management system for GCF and the environmental and social safeguards, Revised <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/environmental-and-social-policy">Environmental and Social Policy</a>, Updated <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/gender-policy">Gender Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/indigenous-peoples-policy">Indigenous Peoples Policy</a>. While drafting the stakeholder engagement plan, you should design strategies to engage in active and open consultation with all stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of the project.</p>

For example, the GCF mandates the <a href="https://irm.greenclimate.fund/">Independent Redress Mechanism</a> which provides recourse to those affected by GCF programmes and projects. Projects can also create ad-hoc mechanisms for redress and conflict resolution as needed by the project, and involving local communities can ensure those mechanisms are appropriate to the needs of the project and the community.</p>

This means looking for ways in which the project can actively look to foster cooperation and communication between different groups that may have a history of tension and conflict, to support existing mechanisms to resolve grievances more effectively, and to encourage natural resource management systems that are inclusive, sustainable and just. &nbsp;There are a number of ways this can be done:</p>

For example, for projects in the Green Climate Fund, we would recomend&nbsp; to include co-benefit(s) indicator(s) and target(s) on peace in the Theory of Change and outcome mapping of the GCF results areas and co-benefits sections, in line with the GCF <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/sites/default/files/document/irmf-policy.pdf">Integrated Results Management Framework policy</a>.</p>                                                </li>

This can involve training and capacity-building programs to develop skills related to energy entrepreneurship. By providing stable economic alternatives and more clean and accessible energy to communities, renewable energy interventions can also reduce the pressure on natural resources and the environment, thus contributing to more secure livelihoods for people and communities.</p>

The</span>se indicators will depend on the context of the project but can revolve around incidents (such as the number of violent events), perceptions (how safe people feel), institutions (for example, whether there are local community groups established to resolve grievances), or processes (for example, how long and difficult it may be to resolve a land dispute through legal channels).</p>

Also, where discriminatory customary practices are deeply embedded, a strategy could be to work with the least discriminatory institutions to at least try to change the status quo and to generate evidence and experience, and raise voices and confidence, for tackling or addressing other institutions.</p>

                                            <p style="text-align:justify">There is a wealth of information on conflict-sensitivity and peace responsive investment and programming. Many of the challenges you might face have been faced, and met before, so we would encourage you to seek advice and support from peer entities and specialized local and international peacebuilding organizations on project design and implementation, and share your ideas and lessons learned on what has worked well.</p>
                                            <p style="text-align:justify">Often, prominent local peacebuilding organizations become apparent through initial engagement with local communities who can recommend civil society partners. In that case, it is important to ensure that the potential partner fulfils due diligence criteria. Due diligence is essential in engaging local civil society actors, particularly in conflict contexts, where organisations from geographic zones different to those where the project is being implemented may not have the same access as local ones and could cause more harm. Examples of considerations for selecting a local civil society partner include:</p>

                                                <li>
                                                <p style="text-align:justify">Has the organization been operational in the geographic area for more than two years?</p>

Major government donors who support peacebuilding organizations would have a focal point who oversees the embassy&rsquo;s peacebuilding or conflict-related work. In all cases, independent due diligence will remain essential to mitigating risks when selecting a local peacebuilding partner.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Summary: Conflict has a deep and interrelated impact on health, food, and water security. With agriculture heavily dependent on freshwater withdrawals, disruptions to water supplies can heavily affect food production, which in turn affects health. In fragile and conflict-affected settings, poor governance and climate change exacerbate these challenges, leading to heightened competition for resources and the weaponization of vital assets like water. Projects in such locations, if not aware of conflict dynamics, can inadvertently exacerbate grievances and undermine their contributions to peace and stability – two key factors needed for long-term success in climate adaptation. Hence, incorporating conflict-sensitivity is vital for effective programming in these settings.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Summary: Projects aimed at enhancing livelihoods through climate-resilient adaptation measures in Fragile and Conflict-affected Settings (FCS) can carry high operational risks.  They may exacerbate conflict by impacting the complex interactions between socio-economic, cultural, and environmental factors that drive fragility, conflict, and violence. For example, such projects may inadvertently disrupt power dynamics amongst groups by implementing livelihood projects that favor one group over another. Being insufficiently aware of conflict dynamics may also undermine the achievement of the project’s goals and its potential to contribute to peace and stability – peace and stability being important pre-requisites for achieving long-term success in climate action. Hence, a comprehensive understanding and application of conflict-sensitive approaches in these projects is not just advisable, but essential for their overall success and sustainability.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Summary: Infrastructure projects in fragile and conflict affected settings are susceptible to numerous operational challenges, which might inadvertently escalate existing socio-economic and political tensions. Infrastructure, being intricately connected to the daily lives and societal needs of communities, often becomes a flashpoint in conflicts. Essential systems like water, energy, and transportation are not just physical assets; they represent broader social, economic, and political structures that can be either symbols of progress or points of contention. When these vital infrastructures are disrupted or commandeered, it can magnify existing societal disparities, restrict access to essential services, and further entrench divisions. However, with thoughtful planning and sensitivity to the local context, these projects can promote peace, address inequalities, and enhance social cohesion. Success in such endeavors often hinges on navigating uncertain political landscapes, adapting to evolving regulatory frameworks, and understanding potential regional complexities.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Summary: Implementing Ecosystem and Ecosystem Services (EES) projects in Fragile and Conflict-affected Settings (FCS) poses both operational challenges and the risk of inadvertently aggravating socio-political dynamics. The intertwined relationship between human, ecological, and economic systems makes these projects sensitive to conflict dynamics related to land access, environmental degradation, and livelihoods. Changes in ecosystems can be exploited by groups like political elites or armed entities, as observed in numerous case studies. Addressing ecosystem degradation offers opportunities for peace-promoting actions, including intercommunal dialogue. Despite their importance, ecosystem services are often undervalued by decision-makers, risking economic and social resilience. The guidance report further details the operational risks projects may face in FCS and emphasizes the importance of inclusive governance and conflict sensitivity.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Summary: Energy plays a key role in human activities, driving economies and societies worldwide. Notably, 85 percent of the 800 million people without energy access live in fragile states. With the growing climate crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels, investments in renewable energy are increasing, especially in Africa due to its vast renewable energy potential. However, there are challenges in introducing renewable energy projects in Fragile and Conflict-affected States (FCS). The rising demand for minerals like cobalt and lithium, essential for renewable technologies, has led to increased conflict and human rights issues since many of these minerals are found in FCS. Large areas of land needed for renewable infrastructure can also lead to disputes, especially in regions with weak governance. But, when managed correctly, renewable energy can promote peace, offering decentralized power systems that benefit remote communities, improve socio-economic outcomes, and encourage collaboration between various stakeholders.</p>

For example, people living in rural areas are highly dependent on transportation to access markets in larger cities, and any changes in transport methods, whether related to conflict or projects interventions, carry a risk of disruption. Yet opportunities exist for projects to enhance trade links through improved transport thus contributing to better economic opportunities for rural producers.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Summary: In Fragile and Conflict-affected Settings (FCS), projects related to buildings, cities, industries, and appliances face multifaceted operational risks. These initiatives, when not judiciously managed, risk heightening tensions by influencing the delicate balance of socio-economic and political factors, thereby amplifying fragility, conflict, and violence. Such challenges are further compounded by weak governance structures, leading to heightened risks of violence and marginalization. Nevertheless, certain urban regions demonstrate remarkable resilience, underscoring the pivotal role of effective governance and cohesive community practices. This guidance note emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing conflict dynamics to ensure the success and positive impact of GCF projects in urban settings.</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Guidance Note for Peace-Informed Programming at the Green Climate Fund</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Summary: Land has historically been a focal point of conflict, especially in Fragile and Conflict-affected Settings (FCS), where disputes over forests and land use often intersect with broader socio-political dynamics, including unfair resource allocation, marginalization, and governance challenges. Factors such as climate change, population growth, and urbanization are anticipated to intensify these conflicts in the coming decades. While projects related to forests and land use aim to address these challenges, they can inadvertently exacerbate tensions, especially if they limit resource access, have weak governance, or marginalize local stakeholders. However, with a conflict-sensitive approach, such projects can promote peace by ensuring equitable land access, fostering sustainable resource management, solidifying land rights, and building trust through community engagement and knowledge-sharing.</p>

                                    <h3 class="text-uppercase">Conflict Assessment</h3>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Consider conducting a <strong>conflict assessment</strong>.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the (sometimes complex) interactions between the impacts of climate change and conflict is particularly important in an area vulnerable to climate change and affected by underlying tensions, whether they are rooted in ethnic, economic, linguistic or social differences. The impacts of climate change can worsen these dividing lines, risking the smooth implementation of project activities. In addition, projects can sometimes unintentionally make the situation worse if the project is &lsquo;blind&rsquo; to those conflict drivers. But equally, being aware of the conflict drivers enables the project to have a &lsquo;peace-positive&rsquo; impact.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">A conflict assessment (or a climate-conflict assessment) is an important first step to understand the underlying drivers of conflict in your project area, to anticipate problems, to ensure your project is not making them worse, and to develop &lsquo;peace-positive&rsquo; solutions. Using a conflict &lsquo;lens&rsquo; is an important way to think through the risks of the project being derailed by, or adding to, conflict. It can be done as a part of the broad socioeconomic risk assessment, or as a separate, additional exercise.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The process of developing your conflict assessment can be as important as the product itself. It is an opportunity to engage with your stakeholders to better understand their needs and concerns. It is also a chance to involve as many of the project team as possible to raise their awareness of the political and social dynamics in the project area. The conflict assessment should be a &lsquo;living document&rsquo; &ndash; something that you can come back to and use time and again as the project evolves.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The conflict assessment should contain the following elements, depending on the needs of your specific project. First, you can use the assessment already done under the climate rationale on the current and projected climate impacts to assess the coping and adaptation capacity and how the project may affect conflict dynamics in the project area. Second, you can build on the mapping of the social and environmental dynamics around the natural resources affected by the project (e.g. land, water, energy) as part of your compliance to ESS and Indigenous People's policies to forecast how the project might/ will change access, control and use of those resources. Finally, utilize your consultation and stakeholder engagement plans to assess who will be affected by the project, how and to what extent.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The conflict assessment needs to:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Involve local stakeholders: </strong>This is essential to ensuring that the project properly anticipates potential conflict issues that could derail the project, ensures that the project does no harm by exacerbating underlying causes of tension, and maximises the opportunities to support peace in the project area.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Consider the potential intersections between climate change impacts and conflict drivers: </strong>Considering the (sometimes complex) interactions between the impacts of climate change and conflict is particularly important in an area vulnerable to climate change and affected by underlying tensions, whether they are rooted in ethnic, economic, linguistic or social differences. The impacts of climate change can worsen these dividing lines, and risk the smooth implementation of project activities. In addition, projects can sometimes unintentionally make the situation worse if the project is &lsquo;blind&rsquo; to those conflict drivers. Equally, being aware of the conflict drivers enables the project to have a &lsquo;peace-positive&rsquo; impact.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Consider the potential constraining factors for the participation, benefit and empowerment of specific groups: </strong>Considering how stakeholders can participate in, benefit from and be empowered by the project is a critical part of designing a successful, impactful project. This is particularly important for sometimes marginalised groups that may otherwise be left out of the design or implementation of the project: such as women, youth, older people, minorities, and the disabled. Involving these stakeholders in the production of a conflict assessment (through focus group discussions, consultations, and - where appropriate - in the analysis team itself) &nbsp;is essential to ensuring that the project includes mechanisms to ensure the full participation of these groups in the project and anticipates potential conflict that could derail the project, ensures that the project does no harm by exacerbating underlying causes of tension, and maximises the opportunities to support peace in the project area.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Quantify the conflict and security risks in the project:</strong> Your conflict assessment should try to outline the conflict and security risks in the proposed project and understand the extent to which they pose threats to the stakeholders of the project, to project staff and/or the successful achievement of the project&rsquo;s goals. Where appropriate, your funding proposal should identify external conflict as a potential risk and outline a plan for mitigating conflict and promoting peace in the targeted region/area. While developing the Theory of Change of the funding proposal, you can identify the pitfalls and levers to mitigate security impacts and maximise co-benefits to increase the resilience of the most vulnerable people and communities by defining the components that can deepen the rift between communities, or, on the contrary, bring them together.</li>
